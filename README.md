# restaurant-website
This modern restaurant website is built using Next.js and enhanced with smooth animations powered by Framer Motion. While learning these technologies, I wanted to challenge myself by creating a full UI experience that mimics a real-world restaurant brand, complete with interactive sections, clean layout, and responsive design.

The goal was to practice component-based development in Next.js and explore how to bring interfaces to life using Framer Motion. The project demonstrates dynamic routing, reusable components, and subtle motion effects that improve user engagement.

This is not just a learning projectâ€”it's a showcase of my ability to build aesthetic, responsive, and animated UIs using modern front-end tools.
